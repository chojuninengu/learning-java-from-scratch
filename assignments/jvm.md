The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the cornerstone of Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy. It's an abstract computing machine that enables Java bytecode to be executed on any device without needing recompilation. The JVM performs several key functions: it loads code, verifies code, executes code, and provides runtime environment. When Java code is compiled, it's transformed into bytecode (.class files) which the JVM then interprets or compiles to native machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. The JVM also handles memory management through garbage collection, automatically freeing memory occupied by unused objects. This architecture provides platform independence while maintaining security and performance, making Java one of the most widely used programming languages.
